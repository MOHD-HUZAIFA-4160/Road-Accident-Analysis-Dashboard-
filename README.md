ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This Road Accident Analysis Dashboard provides actionable insights into accident trends for 2021 & 2022 using Power BI. It helps stakeholders identify patterns, reduce casualties, and improve road safety by analyzing accident severity, location, weather conditions, vehicle types, and monthly trends.

ðŸ“Š Key Features & Contributions:
âœ… Data Preparation & Cleaning:

Extracted and structured large accident datasets from multiple sources.
Removed inconsistencies and ensured data accuracy before loading into Power BI.
âœ… Data Modeling & DAX Calculations:

Built an optimized data model connecting accident severity, road conditions, and locations.
Created DAX measures and calculated columns for YoY growth, accident trends, and severity analysis.
âœ… Dashboard Development & Interactive Visuals:

Designed dynamic KPI cards showing Total Accidents, Fatalities, and Casualties with YoY trends.
Built bar, line, and donut charts to visualize accidents by:
Vehicle Type (Car, Bike, Van, Bus)
Urban vs. Rural Areas
Light & Weather Conditions
Road Type & Location
Implemented drill-through analysis & slicers for real-time filtering.
âœ… Business Impact & Insights:

Urban Areas have higher accidents than rural areas.
March, June, and October show peak accident months.
Single Carriageways are the most accident-prone roads.
More accidents occur in daylight than at night.
